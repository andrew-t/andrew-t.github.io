# About

I am a Manchester-based senior software developer, currently working for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">the BBC</a> in MediaCityUK<span class="footnote" data-html="Which I inisit on pronouncing to rhyme with “audacity”, whatever anyone might think. If they want it pronounced as two words, they should put a space in it."></span>, in Salford Quays. I enjoy making Javascript do mathematics.

Hello!
</div>

I have a PhD in dental image analysis, as well as a Master&rsquo;s degree in Physics.

This is my personal *website*, which I mostly use as a home for my various little projects.
</p></div>

I also draw, sing and <a href="http://twitter.com/Andrew_Taylor">tweet silly jokes</a>. Sometimes I get cross about bad typography, nonsense in the media, or software frameworks that think themselves important enough to warrant my investing *a whole week* to learn them.

This is my personal website, which I mostly use as a home for my various little projects.
