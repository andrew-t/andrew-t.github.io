# dubstep

[dubstep](https://www.github.com/andrew-t/dubstep) works with the [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/) password vault for Bash/GPG, and allows it to store two-factor authenticator credentials and generate one-time log-in codes.

It also includes a command-line QR code generator, in case you have use for such a thing.

# synaesthesia

[synaesthesia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/synaesthesia) adds colour tags to an incoming stream, by default around strings of hex. The idea is that you can compare hashes and signatures at a glance. It also has a setting to replace the hex with a string of emoji, which is easier to read out for confirmation (if you are both using the same settings).
