# Maths

Most months I go to [MathsJam](http://www.mathsjam.com), and most years I’m at the annual MathsJam weekend conference, and so I have a healthy love of recreational mathematics. This is some of the nonsense which has come from that.

## Fractals

I am a big fan of the Mandelbrot Set, and have built [this tool so that you can explore it](http://github.andrewt.net/mandelbrot) (inlined below), and written [this article about how to find <span class="maths">π</span> in there](http://aperiodical.com/2015/03/mandelbrot-pi/) (which uses my exploring gadget).

<div class="float-right"><p>If you are a fan of maths nonsense, you should also check out the <a href="/domputer">Domino Computer</a> and my <a href="/formulae">Stupid Formulæ</a> pages.</p></div>

I have also built [a gadget for playing with Koch snowflake curves](http://github.andrewt.net/snowflake) and [one which generates Sierpinski gaskets from random patterns of dots](http://github.andrewt.net/gasket).

## Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension

I produced some of the ‘DVD extras’ for [Matt Parker](http://www.standupmaths.com)’s book [Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension](https://makeanddo4d.com/), and wrote [this article](http://aperiodical.com/2014/12/things-i-made-and-did/) explaining more about them.

<div class="float-left"><p>I do seem to have become <a href="http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/">Festival of the Spoken Nerd</a>’s tamed programmer. For example, I made <a href="http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/extra-extras/">these alternative subtitles</a> for <a href="http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/dvd/">their DVD</a>.</p></div>

The [Polygonal Number Checker](http://makeanddo4d.com/polygonal-number-calculator/) is the best part.

## Conway’s Game of Life

I once built [an infinitely large version of Conway’s Game of Life](http://github.andrewt.net/conway). It’s a little glitchy, but it mostly works.
