## [Horsemeat](horsemeat)

[The horsemeat scandal](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/horsemeat-scandal) has been funny for at least three years and is showing no signs of stopping being funny, particularly for vegetarians. In this crossword (which suffers somewhat from a lack of checked cells), the grid entries are marred by the same issue.

## [Bakeoff](bake-off)

This crossword was made to coincide with the last episode of The Great British Bake-off before [it moved to Channel 4](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off).
