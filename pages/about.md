I am a Manchester-based senior software developer, currently working for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">the BBC</a> in MediaCityUK, in Salford Quays. I enjoy making Javascript do mathematics.

I have a PhD in dental image analysis, as well as a Masterâ€™s degree in Physics.

I also draw, sing and <a href="http://twitter.com/Andrew_Taylor">tweet silly jokes</a>. Sometimes I get cross about bad typography, nonsense in the media, or software frameworks that think themselves important enough to warrant my investing *a whole week* to learn them.

This is my personal website, which I mostly use as a home for my various little projects.
