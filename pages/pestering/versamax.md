I got this email quite out of the blue:

<blockquote class="scam-them">

<br><br>

<br>

<br>

<br><br>

<br>
Janet J.

<br><br>

Reply me asap with your website or product lists.</blockquote>

Clearly it's some kind of scam, but it's not yet clear which one. Well, only one way to find out.

<blockquote class="scam-me">Hi Janet,
<br><br>
1. Yes, I accept credit cards.<br>
2. Yes, I can ship to Lagos.<br>
3. I can ship using FedEx, but not UPS because they killed my daughter and I boycot them now.
</blockquote>

…and I attached a product list. It was quite silly.

<blockquote class="scam-them">
Hello,
<br><br>
Thanks for the mail back,However i will like you to calculate the product below including shipping and get back to me
<br><br>
Item Sixteen....................................5pcs
<br>

<br>

<br><br>
Shipping Address:<br>
26,Oguntoye street,<br>
Mushin Lagos<br>
Nigeria 23401.
<br><br>
I will  be waiting for your swift response.</blockquote>

Just to be clear on how silly my produt list is: item sixteen is a shoe. I made no claims as to which foot it was for, but by buying five Janet had got herself a pretty good chance of getting a pair. Item fourteen is a pack of batteries, in which batteries are not included.

<blockquote class="scam-me">
I've had a look at the shipping prices, and the price is as follows:
<br><br>
Products: £722.40<br>Shipping: £80.00 (subject to change)<br>Total: £802.40
<br><br>
I'll do it for £800 if the shipping price isn't much above £80.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-them">

<br><br>

<p>And now we're being scammed. They just want phones. Well, I can do phones. I negotiated Janet up a bit, and quoted her this:</p>

<blockquote class="scam-them">
Hi Janet,
<br><br>
Here is your new order, as it currently stands:
<br><br>
Items from product list (18 total).......£1122.30<br>
Nokia 8800 (5)........................................£759.00<br>
Shipping..................................................£125.00<br>
Total.......................................................£2006.30 + VAT
<br><br>
The items from theproduct list are 5 shoes, three monitors, and 9 battery packs. If you would like to make any changes, please tell me.</blockquote>

Next, Janet sent me eight sets of credit card details to spread the cost across, and a shipping address. As tempting as it was to buy myself some plasma TVs under Janet's name, I'm not 100% sure it would have been a great idea.

<blockquote class="scam-me">Hi Janet,
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I can't take credit card orders directly via email. You'll have to use the website like everybody else. Sorry about that.
<br><br>
Andrew</blockquote>

Then Janet said something that caught me off-guard.

<blockquote class="scam-them">
Pls i wil like to let you know that i am a very busy man i want you to do me the favour by helping me go to the website.</blockquote>

I'd rather assumed he was a very busy _woman_.

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Further to my last email, you will be pleased to learn that the website has just been brought back online. Apparently the problem was that one of the cleaners had unplugged the server to plug in her vaccuum cleaner, and when she'd plugged it back in it had reverted to "evil" mode. Once we switched it back it worked perfectly.
</blockquote>

And I included a link to "the website", which was just a dumb webform I'd built that afternoon. It asked for the customer's address, shipping address, invoice address and Gettysburg address, as well as the name and colour of their credit card.

Janet did not fill out the colour of his card. His card is named "Master Card" which I am choosing to assume is a clever pun.

<blockquote class="scam-me">
!!!ERROR
<br><br>
Your order was rejected for the following reason(s):
<br><br>
-- Failure to complete card details.
<br><br>
<br>We aplogoise for the inconvenience

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-them">
I will like to let me know what else i am suppose to fill
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-me">
This is an automatic response from the VersaMax Ordering Daemon.
<br><br>
If your items did not arrive, please wait until they do.
<br><br>
To use the VersaMax online store you must complete ALL card details. Some details do not apply to all cards. If for example your card has no colour, say because it is invisible, then enter "N/A" in that box.
<br><br>
If you wish to return an item, please send it via carrier monkey to VersaMax HQ, Seattle, Columbia, Spain, SW1 2PR.
<br><br>
Thanks,<br>VersaMax Customer Service Team
</blockquote>

So, he filled in a new order, this time asking for some different items again, and I acknowledged it:

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Your odrer with VersaMax stores was successful, and will be dispatched when you are registered as a VersaMax customer.
<br><br>
VersaMax Customer Disservice Team
</blockquote>

I included another webform. This one asked for the new customer's height, star sign, favourite colour, date of birth, date of death, nature of death, and favourite member of Take That.

Janet, or Jayeola as he apparently likes to be known, likes the colour BLUE.

<blockquote class="scam-me">
To verify your account and complete registration, please fill in this brief form.
<br><br>
This will allow your account to be verified and any orders you may have placed to be dispatched. Thankyou for your time, and happy shopping!
<br><br>
The VersaMax Customer Aggreivance Team</blockquote>

This form attempted to prove the customer was a human by asking them to think of a name for a robot (Janet suggested "Funmilola") and tick fifty checkboxes (which computers are famously bad at).

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Congratulations!
<br><br>
You are the 1,000,000th customer registered at VersaMax online stores, and qualify for our STAR PRIZE -- five FREE Nokia 8800 mobile phones, with chargers, manuals, fuel, and carrycase! (If you have ordered any part of the prize then as a goodwill gesture that order will be cancelled automatically to prevent customers wasting money buying things they have won anyway.)
<br><br>
To claim your prize, please reply to this email with "STAR PRIZE" as the subject line, and fill the body of the email with the phrase "My name is Jack Bauer and I'm a federal agent" one hundred times. (We suggest you copy-paste it rather than typing it every time!) This is to prevent automated responses.
<br><br>
Thankyou, congratulations, and we hope you enjoy your prize!
<br><br>
Yours,<br>The VersaMax Customer Assimilation Collective
</blockquote>

Janet replied with the phrase

<blockquote class="scam-them">
My name janet jeffrey i am a wholesaler
</blockquote>

one hundred and forty six times, because he likes to be sure. But that isn't what I asked for, and so he gets another stupid form. To claim his STAR PRIZE, he had to input his name, email, favourite bridge, wingspan, favourite bridge, and whether or not he would go back and kill baby Hitler. For the tiebreak, I asked him to prove Goldbach's conjecture in fifteen words or less. I also asked for a photo. None was forthcoming.

<blockquote class="scam-them">
Hello,
<br><br>
I am still waiting for your swift response.concerning my order i want you to get it shipped and get back to me with my shipping details.
<br><br>
Regards<br>
Jeffrey.</blockquote>

After a short chat with Chloe O'Brian, VersaMax Customer Service Droid (me), she forwarded Janet's message to Bill, head of STAR PRIZEs (also me).

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Hi Janet,
<br><br>
Chloe has forwarded your email to me. First, let me say congratulations on winning the STAR PRIZE.
<br><br>
Our trade magazine (circulation about 1,500) would like to run an article about the winner of the STAR PRIZE. Would it be possible for our editor, George Mason, to ask you a few questions for the article? It would only be simple things, and we'll send you a copy of the article once it goes out.
<br><br>
Would it be possible to get a photograph of you for the article as well?
<br><br>
Bill Buchannan<br>Head of STAR PRIZEs
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-them">
Thanks for the mail back,However I will also thank your company for giving me this star prize,Also I will want you to know that concerning the article you are talking about I will want you to not worry about it,I am a very busy Man I dont always have time nowadays,So I will like you to find my shipping info below.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Let me get on that now. In the meantime, George has asked me to inform you that, for policy reasons, we have to run an article about all winners. If you don't want to cooperate he says that's OK and he'll just make something up. We'll still send you a copy, of course, when it is released.
<br><br>
If you don't want him to make something up just email me back with a few details for him to include and I'll see that he gets them. I'll let you know what's happenning with your STAR PRIZE as soon as I know myself.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-them">
I will like you to send the article to me,Also get back to me with the shiping details
</blockquote>

I sent a PDF of our newsletter, which carried the following stories:

<blockquote>
<b>VersaMax — Because your needs are unimportant.</b>
<br><br>
<b>Sales increase and decrease simultaneously</b><br>
Sales of VersaMax products are said to have increased and decreased sporadically this month, resulting in a net increase of 5% and a net decrease of 7%. When asked if this was a positive or negative turn of events, sales manager Tony Almeida said, “In many ways, it’s both. Certainly the increase in sales is a positive development and one which we should be proud of, but the accompanying drop in those same sales is a problem we must address.”
<br><br>
<b>VersaMax Company Tie Chosen</b><br>
The new VersaMax company tie was selected last night by the board of directors at Division. It will not be officially unveiled until last Wednesday, but is said to include at least nine griffins. It is unusual for a VersaMax tie to include more than five griffins, so this is an interesting  decision sure to prove controversial with VersaMax’ more conservative employees.
<br><br>
<b>VersaMax Declared Independent State</b><br>
See pages 9-14
<br><br>
<b>VersaMax all-midget customer base ruled “coincidence”</b><br>
See page 3
<br><br>
<b>STAR PRIZE WINNER</b><br>
As promised when VersaMax was founded, the one-millionth customer will shortly be receiving her STAR PRIZE from VersaMax. The prize is four US dollars, and the winner of these dollars is Janet Jeffery, a wholesaler from Middle Earth. She owns Europa’s largest branch of Starbucks, and once ate an entire puppy just for the hell of it.
<br><br>
Her favourite pastime is hurting children. She has three children of her own, the survivors of a total litter of nineteen.
<br><br>
Janet declined to send a photograph, so we took this one while she was in the shower.
<br><br>
Her business interests have taken her to such exotic countries as the UK, the Ukraine and the Ukraineslovalabant. Her former employer, God, said of her “I hate her. I’m fairly sure I saw her stealing holy water once. I’m not certain how, because I was giving it away for free at the time, but she definitely gave the impression that she was stealing it.”
<br><br>
Two of her eyes are myopic. She writes limericks for Komputer Fur Alle magazine. Her legs are made of cotton. Her favourite T-shirt reads, “I am a cauliflower”. She can recite pi to a hundred decimal places (including the three) but cannot remember which of her children is Naomi and if that’s the same one as broke her leg while playing the special cliff-diving game she invented for her. Her husband left her in 1992 after only an hour of marriage because he meant to marry someone else with a similar name. For more information about Janet Jeffery and more photographs of her in the shower, please see pages 15 through 30.<br></em></blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-them">
Can you pls expain what you mean by all this rubbish you are writing about me.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-me">
We always run an article on our STAR PRIZE winners. It's what we do. As you declined to give an interview I had to guess at most of it. Was I close to the mark?
<br><br>
If you wish, we can run a correction in the next issue -- just tell me what you'd like amending.

<blockquote class="scam-them">
i am ok with it,just get back to me asap with my shipping details.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Shipping? We thought it would be easier just to give you the four dollar STAR PRIZE as store credit. It would cost us more than four dollars to ship it to you, after all!
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="scam-me">
Hi Janet, 
<br><br>
Just thought I'd let you know that everything has been sorted out and that your STAR PRIZE of FOUR DOLLARS will be sent as soon as you nominate an account. Please get back to me and let me know where you'd like it sending. 
<br><br>
Thanks, 
<br><br>

Head of STAR PRIZES

Bill did not get a reply.
