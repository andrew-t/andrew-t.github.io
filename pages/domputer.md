As part of the [Manchester Science Festival](http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/) 2012, [Matt Parker](http://www.standupmaths.com) decided to demonstrate how computers worked by building one out of dominoes.

I was part of the team which built it, and helped design the layout.

Matt has also produced [these explanatory worksheets](http://www.think-maths.co.uk/downloads/domino-computer-worksheets) aimed at teachers, and [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ) which goes a little deeper into the workings of the domino computer.

In short, though, the computer is made of “wires”, which are made of normal domino chains. Apart from the fact they can only be used once, they work much the same way as the connections in a normal, electrical circuit.

These wires are then combined into logic gates, by bending, splitting, crossing and combining them so that the required outputs fall. The gates combine into binary adders, which are essentially the same thing as logic gates, but with more bespoke outcomes. The adders are then combined into the final computer, as each adder can only be used once, so we need to have one for each bit of the input.

There is also a giant timing line, and a set of wires leading to a “display”.
