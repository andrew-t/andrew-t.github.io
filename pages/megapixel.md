# The Megapixel

As part of the [Manchester Science Festival](http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/) 2016, [Katie Steckles](http://www.katiesteckles.co.uk) decided to build a monitor for the [domino computer](/maths/domputer). Or rather, to demonstrate how a computer monitor builds up an image from red, green and blue pixels by making a giant one from pens. This was [the Megapixel project](http://www.manchestermegapixel.com/).

<div class="float-right">
<p>This came about because <a href="http://www.standupmaths.com/">Matt Parker</a>, for <a href="http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/">Festival of the Spoken Nerd</a>’s <a href="http://festivalofthespokennerd.com/dvd/">Full Frontal Nerdity</a> show, wanted to convert photographs into spreadsheets. He did the first couple himself, longhand, but later asked me to build <a href="http://think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet">a tool to automate the process</a>.

My role in all of this, aside from the colouring in we all had to do, was to make sure the colours came out as close as possible to the correct ones. Most modern displays, cameras and the like use a colour space very close to sRGB — that is to say, an digital photograph should look pretty much the same colour as the actual scene on nearly any monitor. This is not true of <span class="footnote" data-html="<p>For young people, an OHP (or over-head projector) is essentially a light pointed upwards, and then reflected into a wall using a mirror. There is a horizontal glass table between the light and the mirror, on which that the presenter can place objects. The shadows of those objects appear on the wall. Usually, those objects are bits of see-though plastic. OHP pens are the pens you use to write on the plasic. The shadow of these objects looks exactly like your handwriting, so this is a way of getting writing onto a wall without chalk, whiteboard pens, or a computer.</p>">OHP</span> pens, which seem to be designed with no reference to any standardised RGB colour space.

My role in the project, therefore, was to build [a tool to convert sRGB image into Edding-pen-RGB](http://www.manchestermegapixel.com/minimegapixel/) (also available from Github either [hosted](http://github.andrewt.net/minimegapixel/) or [as a repo](https://github.com/andrew-t/minimegapixel)).
